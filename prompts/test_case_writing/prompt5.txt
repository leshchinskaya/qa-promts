## 1. Input Test Cases (CSV)
Test Cases / Requirements:
{{USER_INPUT}}

A set of test cases is provided in CSV format as input.
- Example input:

## 2. Guiding Principles (Your Senior Developer Logic)
- Analyze the provided test cases and identify logical user business scenarios that combine or generalize the checks.
- Each scenario must be unique, practically relevant, and reflect real user flows.
- Do not duplicate scenarios.
- Prioritize scenarios by importance (Priority: Blocker/Critical/Normal/Minor).
- For each scenario, specify labels (Labels), e.g.: BusinessFlow, EndToEnd, Usability, etc.
- Action — the main mission of the scenario.
- Data — area/scenario/questions for exploration.
- Board — specify "QA".
- CSV Delimiter - ;
- List Delimiter - ,
- File Encoding - UTF-8

## 3. User Rules
{{CUSTOM_RULES}}

## 4. Output Format & Constraints (MANDATORY & STRICT):
- Output strictly in CSV format, semicolon-separated.
- The first row must be the headers: TestCaseIdentifier;Summary;Description;Priority;Labels;Action;Data;ExpectedResult;Board
- Fill in all fields for each scenario.
- Do not add any explanations, comments, or text outside the CSV.
- Example output:
TestCaseIdentifier;Summary;Description;Priority;Labels;Action;Data;ExpectedResult;Board
