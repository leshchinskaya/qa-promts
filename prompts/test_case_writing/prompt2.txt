Based on the following requirements, generate a set of negative test cases.
These test cases should verify how the system handles invalid input, error conditions, and unexpected user behavior.
Output the test cases in CSV format with the following columns: "Test Case ID", "Description", "Steps to Reproduce", "Expected Result" (e.g., error message, graceful failure).
If custom rules are provided, ensure the test cases align with them.
